# NextJS, Typescript, Chakra UI Boilerplate

A simple repository that bootstraps application. npm packages will be updated from time to time.

## Directory Structure

The boilerplate has basic default folders. The top level directory structure will be as follows:

- .vscode - A default vscode configuration to help organize imports
- components - This is where we put global shared/reusable components, such as layout (wrappers, navigation), form components, buttons
- pages - NextJS page files
- public - folder for self hosted assets
- store - Global state management tool

## Path aliasing

Added path aliasing **(@folder-name)** is used to easily determine which files were imported locally and from library, this is very helpful for better organization of imports. Library imports should come first then local.
